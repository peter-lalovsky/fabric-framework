Mirrored Azure SQL Database
***************************

We can mirror only Azure SQL Server

Source database --> System assigned managed identity --> Status --> On

Columns with sys.columns.is_replicated = 0 are not replicated (mirrored)

-- Run this on the source Azure SQL Server to get the columns that will not be replicated
SELECT
  S.[name]   AS [schema_name]
  , T.[name] AS table_name
  , C.[name] AS column_name
FROM
  sys.schemas      AS S
  JOIN sys.tables  AS T ON S.[schema_id] = T.[schema_id]
  JOIN sys.columns AS C ON T.[object_id] = C.[object_id]
WHERE
  C.is_replicated = 0
  -- AND... -- add your conditions here
ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;
 
The destination is "Mirrored Database"
	Has SQL endpoint, i.e. this is a database and we can run cross-database queries

		Create a shortcut
			You first need to create a shortcut from your mirrored tables into the Lakehouse, and then build notebooks with Spark queries in your Lakehouse.
			In the Fabric portal, open Data Engineering.
			If you don't have a Lakehouse created already, select Lakehouse and create a new Lakehouse by giving it a name.
			Select Get Data -> New shortcut.
			Select Microsoft OneLake.
			You can see all your mirrored databases in the Fabric workspace.
			Select the mirrored database you want to add to your Lakehouse, as a shortcut.
			Select desired tables from the mirrored database.
			Select Next, then Create.
